# IP-Lookup-Algorithms
Implemented binary Trie and binary search on prefix range lookup algorithms.The code on receiving IP packet extracted
destination IP and performed lookup to match longest prefix
Compared performance of both the algorithms based on lookup speed,storage requirements,update time,scalability &
fexilibility in implementation
To test code functionality, the algorithm modules will be integrated with packet capturer APIs provided by PCAP library, to allow reading IP packets from the laptopâ€™s Network Interface Card (NIC).
